ToDo / Required: 
1. remove  google analytics
2. remove  dynamic innerHtml combined with "remote content" (googleapis.com/youtube)

More:
3. add m.youtube / *.youtube.com  (firefox add on is available on phones!) 
(but repo should also have m.youtube  permissions(,facebook,everywhere)(only the Google Webstore version remains www.youtube, until we announce change there)
4. Firefox version currently has commented   // video.parentNode.parentNode.pauseVideo();   as autopause bug was confusing
