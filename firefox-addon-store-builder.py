ToDo / Required: 
1. removing  dynamic innerHtml combined with "remote content" (googleapis.com/youtube)
2. removing  google analytics (or add it only for google webstore version)

More:
3. adding m.youtube / *.youtube.com  (firefox add on is available on phones!) 
(but repo should also have m.youtube  permissions(,facebook,everywhere)
(only the Google Webstore version remains www.youtube - unless we announce a change there)

4. Firefox version currently has commented   // video.parentNode.parentNode.pauseVideo();   as autopause bug was confusing
