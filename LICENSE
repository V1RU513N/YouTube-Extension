COMMENT/Postamble: Reason for specific restriction: Some publishers use our code without permission commercially, with excessive adware/spyware. 
Together they can have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well. 
Thus we rationally/responsibly have to care. Inspite of the tendency for smart behavior, to be superior on a long-term, as assumed by licences like GNU, 
marketing / competition is not always fair in the present, as billions of users dont seem to review every software choice.
(- and no meaningfully modified & commercial re-publishing can be expected to be necessary without asking)
