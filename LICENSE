Draft (Talk to us? ☺) :

(three Freedoms:)
1. Personal use:  
This was made for you ♡  (If you like it consider donating. Our work is efficient. If you modify or add anything we are happy if you please take the time to post it in our Repo or tell us? ☺  Should you find any parts relevant in a different context, we are curious/amazed too)

2. Contributors: 
Unlike other licences we would like to acknowledge that you become a shareholder of this project / 'cooperative'. 
Proportionally to the time well spent. Please feel free to vote about our actions.

3. Publishers:  
All unmodified Distribution welcome! permitted. (just don't wrap it in 'installation assistents' / drive-by installs)

3.1. Modified, but non-commercial Charity/NGO:   
Please link to us prominently. Or ask?

(one Restriction:)  
3.2. Commercial & modified use (both at once)   
Written permission/contract required. Except: OS's, Open Source Initiativ, Debian, Fedora!
No such permission was granted.  However commercial projects keep using our code without permission.  Some who feature adware / spyware. 
Together they easily have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well!
-  Thus we rationally/responsibly do have to care
(,despite the tendency for smart behavior to be superior on a long-term, marketing is not fair. Billions of users dont seem to review their software choice.) .
(also no meaningful, modified & commercial re-publishing is expectable for this project)
(And Publishing as a whole or in any free Operating Systems should be possible!)

(No warranty / liablity)
Thank you
