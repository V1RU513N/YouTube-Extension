FUTURE DRAFT (Talk to us? ☺) :
FREEDOM: 
1. Personal use:  This was made for you ♡  (If you like it consider donating. Our work is efficient. If you modify or add anything,  we are happy if you please take the time to post it in our Repo or tell us? ☺  Should you find any parts relevant in a different context, we are curious/amazed too)
2. Contributors:   Unlike other licences we would like to acknowledge that you become a shareholder of this project / 'cooperative'. 
Proportionally to the time well spent. Please feel free to vote about our actions.
3. Publishers:  Unmodified Distribution welcome! permitted. (just don't wrap it in 'installation assistents' / drive-by installs)
3.1. Modified use by registered Charity organisations:   Please link to us prominently. Or ask? (We can help you!)

ONLY RESTRICTION:
3.2. Publishing modified versions commercially (=commercially repurosing pieces of the code, that are not the full, such as 'version 3.250'):   
Written permission/contract required. No such permission was granted to anybody as of 2021. Exception: OS's, Open Source Initiativ, Debian, Fedora.   (The unmodified original is: https://github.com/code4charity/YouTube-Extension, including all versions)

COMMENT/Postamble: Reason for specific restriction: Commercial publishers keep using our code without permission.  Some with excessive adware/spyware. 
Together they easily have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well!
Thus we rationally/responsibly have to care. (,despite the tendency for smart behavior, 
to be superior on a long-term, marketing / competition is not always fair in the present as billions of users dont seem to review every software choice.
- no meaningful, modified & commercial re-publishing is expectable for this project(?)
