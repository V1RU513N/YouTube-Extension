FURTHER DRAFT (Talk to us? ☺) :

Freedom:
1. Personal use:  
This was made for you ♡  (If you like it consider donating. Our work is efficient. If you modify or add anything we are happy if you please take the time to post it in our Repo or tell us? ☺  Should you find any parts relevant in a different context, we are curious/amazed too)

2. Contributors: 
Unlike other licences we would like to acknowledge that you become a shareholder of this project / 'cooperative'. 
Proportionally to the time well spent. Please feel free to vote about our actions.

3. Publishers:  
All unmodified Distributiors welcome! permitted. (just don't wrap it in 'installation assistents' / drive-by installs)

3.1. Modified, published by registered Charity organisation:   
Please link to us prominently. Or ask?

Restriction: 
3.2. All Commercial & modified use (both at once)  (or commercial & using pieces):   
Written permission/contract required. 
No such permission was granted. Exception: OS's, Open Source Initiativ, Debian, Fedora!
However commercial projects keep using our code without permission.  Some with ads / adware / spyware. 
Together they easily have more users than the original, since software is often not chosen well!
-  Thus we rationally/responsibly do have to care
(,despite the tendency for smart behavior, to be superior on a long-term, marketing / competition is not always fair. Billions of users dont seem to review their software choice.)
(also no meaningful, modified & commercial re-publishing is expectable for this project)
(And Publishing as a whole or in any free Operating Systems should be possible, unless unrestrained copyleft is a religion)

(No warranty / liablity)
Thank you
