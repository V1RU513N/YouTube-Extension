# ToDo / Required 
# EVERY EXTENSION: 
# - Edge: doesnt allow chrome update url 
# - update urls by browser: https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx ,  https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx 

# - Extention name: Edge&Whale deny ' (Replace with *)  + Whale denies '&' (replace with '+')  +  Opera denies Emoji (delete)

Microsoft store has a bug/complification with languages https://github.com/code4charity/YouTube-Extension/discussions/966#discussioncomment-963315

# - Firefox: remove or comment-out: dynamic innerHtml, where it calls "remote content" (googleapis.com/youtube)

# - Firefox, Opera: Removing  google analytics (or removing from Repo & adding it only for google webstore version?)

# ImprovedTube:
# - Repo will include m.youtube permission (firefox addons are available on phones), *.youtube.com 
     +global permission, to help with all videos. 
     (besides Google Webstore version remains with www.youtube only(by mistake), until we announce that.

# Version 3.2: Firefox has commented-out  // video.parentNode.parentNode.pauseVideo();   (autoplay-bug)
