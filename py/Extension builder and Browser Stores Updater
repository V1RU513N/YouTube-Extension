# ToDo / Required 
# EVERY EXTENSION: 
# - Edge: doesnt allow chrome update url 
# - Edge & Whale: deny ' in name (documentation?). Replace with '*'.  Whale also denies '&' replace with '+' 
# - update urls by browser: https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx ,  https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx 

# - Firefox: removing  dynamic innerHtml combined with "remote content" (googleapis.com/youtube)
# - Firefox, Opera: Removing  google analytics (or removing from Repo & adding it only for google webstore version?)

# ImprovedTube:
# - Repo will include m.youtube permission (firefox addons are available on phones) , global video permission, *.youtube.com 
       (besides Google Webstore version remains with www.youtube only(by mistake), until we announce that.
# - Firefox: Currently has commented   // video.parentNode.parentNode.pauseVideo();   as firefox-autop-bug was confusing
